# 🧠 VAE-Based Alzheimer's Data Augmentation

**DermaIQ – AI Skin Expert** is a professional portfolio project that applies **deep generative modeling** to tackle a key problem in healthcare AI: **limited and sensitive Alzheimer’s imaging datasets**.

Using a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**, this project learns meaningful features from real MRI scans and generates synthetic samples that closely mimic true neurodegenerative patterns — helping improve model training, validation, and research without compromising privacy.

## 🎯 Purpose

In real-world healthcare AI, especially for Alzheimer’s disease:
- 🔒 **Data privacy** is a major hurdle
- 📉 **Limited datasets** reduce model performance and generalization
- 🧪 **More data** is needed for meaningful deep learning research

This project demonstrates a **scalable, ethical**, and **cost-effective** solution using VAE-generated synthetic data.
